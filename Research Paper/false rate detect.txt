A system’s false
match rate (FMR) and false nonmatch
rate (FNMR) depend on the operating
threshold; a large threshold score leads
to a small FMR at the expense of a high
FNMR. For a given fingerprint matching system, it is impossible to reduce
both these errors simultaneously

false positive identification
rate (FPIR) 
FPIR = 1 - (1 - FMR)N, where N is
the number of users enrolled in the
system.

Lets assume you have a biometric evaluation system that assigns all authentication attempts a 'score' between closed 
interval [0, 1]. 0 means no match at all and 1 means a full match. If the threshold is set to 0, then all the users 
including the genuine (positive) and the impostors (negative) are authenticated. If you threshold is set to 1 then there 
is a high risk that no one may be authenticated. Therefore, in realtime systems the threshold is kept somewhere between 
0 and 1. So, this threshold setting can sometimes may not authenticate the genuine users, which is called FRR 
(False Reject Rate) but may also authenticate the imposters, which is given by FAR (False Accept Rate).
Here, FP: False positive, FN: False Negative, FN: True Negative and TP: True Positive
FAR is calculated as a fraction of negative scores exceeding your threshold.
FAR = imposter scores exceeding threshold/all imposter scores.
imposter scores exceeding threshold = FP
all imposter scores = FP+TN
FAR = FPR = FP/(FP+TN)
FRR is calculated as a fraction of positive scores falling below your threshold.
FRR = genuines scores exceeding threshold/all genuine scores
genuines scores exceeding threshold = FN
all genuine scores = TP+FN
FRR = FNR = FN/(TP+FN)


FAR is calculated as a fraction of impostor scores exceeding your threshold.

FRR is calculated as a fraction of genuine scores falling bellow your threshold.

Example: We have a fingerprint system. In order to evaluate a performance of any biometric system, we need to gather a 
database. Assume, that we have done that and the database consists of 10 legitimate users (USER_1-USER_10) and each 
user provided his finger 10 times (10x10 = 100 images in total). Lets assume, that single image is sufficient for 
template creation. You select a user (e. g. USER_1) and one his fingerprint image and create the template. The rest 
of his images you use to verify the fingerprint and you receive 9 genuine scores. All images of other users you use 
as a impostors and you receive 90 impostor scores. You repeat the template generation for all images and all users 
and in total you receive 900 genuine scores and 9000 impostor scores. These scores are usually used to generate so 
called ROC curves to choose the best threshold suting your problem. If you have chosen a threshold, you can calculate
 the FAR and FRR using the definition I stated above.

Lets assume, that we have chosen as threshold 0.7 and 100 impostor scores exceed the threshold and 50 genuine scores 
fall below the threshold.
FAR =imposter scores exceeding your threshold / all imposter scores  ==100/9000 ==0.011
FRR = genuine scores falling bellow your threshold / all genuine scores   ==50/900 ==0.056
So FAR = 1.1% and FRR = 5.6%.

TAR = 1−FAR
TRR = 1−FRR



Assuming you got dissimilarity score normalized between 0 to1.
For any score threshold value (say s), you have to calculate
[a] Number of genuine matching having score more than s = False Reject (FR)
[b] Number imposter matching equal to or less than s = False Accept (FA)
So, for current threshold (s) : 
FRR=FR/Total Genuine Matching
FAR=FA / Total Imposter Matching
In this way one can compute FAR and FRR for all s in {0 to 1} at an step of say 0.0001. Finally, plot FAR and FRR w.r.t 
to the threshold value, which is considered as ROC curve.

First minutiae tables are constructed for both probe and gallery fingerprint as shown in
Fig.3.3. In the table 𝑋, 𝑌 represents the coordinates of each minutiae, 𝑇 represents
orientation 𝜃 and 𝐷 represents the minutiae quality. These tables containing all
minutiae parameters are then passed to the minutiae matcher for generating the
scores. S(P1,P2) represents scores obtained from genuine matach where 𝑃1 and
𝑃2 are the fingerprints from same person. 𝑆(𝐺1, 𝐺2) represents scores obtained from
imposter matach where 𝐺1 and 𝐺2 are the fingerprints from different persons. As
larger the matching score, the fingerprints are more likely from the same person.

False Acceptance Rate (FAR): the percentage of identification instances in which unauthorised persons are incorrectly accepted.
False Rejection Rate (FRR): the percentage of identification instances in which authorised persons are incorrectly rejected.
